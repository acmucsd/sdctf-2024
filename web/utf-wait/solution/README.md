# UTFâ€”wait.

The way UTF-8 is defined, it can allow characters to be encoded in multiple ways, so the specification explicitly requires decoders to reject these over-long encodings.

This uses its own text encoder that is presented as a cute naive developer that wants Unicode support for their web server. However, the encoder produces invalid UTF-8 encodings by always producing over-long character encodings. Proper UTF-8 decoders, like those used in browsers, will not accept these encodings and will display U+FFFD, the invalid encoding character.

To solve this challenge, users must realize the encoding scheme used by the web server:

- The title, "UTF-wait," suggests the challenge involves UTF-8.
- Only emojis, which require the full 4 bytes to be encoded, are rendered correctly in the browser.

Then, the user must make their own lenient UTF-8 decoder to inspect the website source. From looking at the HTML, they can see that the server gives notes when given a note name in the request body. But `flag` returns a 404 error.

The user must figure out that they have to encode `flag` the same way the server does. There are 16 possible ways it could be encoded, which is kind of a brute force but not really.
