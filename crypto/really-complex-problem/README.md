### Description

> We have a ciphertext that we have to decrypt in 48 hours. Luckily, one of our guys at the NSA was able to take a screenshot of the computer as it was performing the encryption, unfortunately it only captured part of the screen. Can you help us break the cipher?

### Hints

> I overheard from some colleagues that there's a way to solve this for normal RSA, I'm not clear on the details but they said something about reducing an integer lattice basis. I dunno if that will work here, though - how do you even represent complex numbers in a matrix? Makes no sense to me.
